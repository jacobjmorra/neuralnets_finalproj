Results so far..

- model is now same as one in paper
- 45% test accuracy on 10000 test images CIFAR-10 (random chance is 10%)
- test accuracy similar to paper
- created numerosity test images

Next steps..
- test our HCNN on numerosity images (remove fc layers), check activations
- plot a histogram which shows preference for particular numerosities
