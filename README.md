Results so far..

- model is now same as one in paper
- 45% test accuracy on 10000 test images CIFAR-10 (random chance is 10%)
- test accuracy similar to paper


Next steps..
- create or get numerosity test images, test our HCNN on them (remove fc layers)
- check activations after 3rd round of convolution in response to the images
- plot a histogram which shows preference for particular numerosities
